inputs to p1.exe (original.cpp): 
	12 \n 8 \n 4 - returns Brian win prediction, as expected
	12 \n 8 \n 8 - returns Brian win prediction, nonsensical because total votes > numberSurveyed
	12 \n 8 \n -1 - returns Gavin win prediction, nonsensical because negative votes are not possible
	12 \n 6 \n 6 - returns Brian win prediction, incorrect because votes are equal 

changes to logic_error.cpp:
	line 20-21: deleted '100.0*' from expression
       program does not return percentage of votes, instead outputs 0.0% for both Gavin and Brian

changes to compile_error.cpp:
	line 20: deleted semicolon
	line 30: changed 'forBrian' to 'Brian', an undeclared variable
compiler recognizes missing semicolon in line 20 and undeclared identifier 'Brian', program does not compile
